# This is a Competitive Programming Practice Repo
This repository contains all my competitive programming practice along with my custom made cplib library (which is essentially my template), along with a expander. As you can see, most of my practice was originally in USACO but nowadays I have started to do codeforces and may do other competitive programming platforms. My codeforces handle is [@kondasujay2](https://codeforces.com/profile/kondasujay2). All the libraries that I use are in the lib folder, and "Implementations" is an old folder containing old implementations that I plan to migrate to my library.
